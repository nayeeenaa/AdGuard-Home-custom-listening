# AdGuard-Home-Whitelist

There are always pros and cons to use whitelists. I started with Pihole, but now I have AdGuard Home. Overblocking is not a permanent solution either. That's why I started to create a whitelist for AdGuard Home. 

If you have remaks or wishes please feel free to contact me.
